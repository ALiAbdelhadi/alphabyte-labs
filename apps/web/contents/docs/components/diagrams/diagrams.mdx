## Example

### Flowchart

<ComponentPreview name="diagram-demo" />

### Decision Tree

Decision trees illustrate choices and possible outcomes, making them ideal for decision-making workflows or processes involving multiple paths.

<ComponentPreview name="diagram-demo" variant="decision-tree" />

### Entity-Relationship Diagram

Entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) are used to model relationships between entities in a system. They are widely used in database design and system architecture planning.

<ComponentPreview name="diagram-demo" variant="entity-relationship" />

Each of these diagrams serves a specific purpose and Mermaid makes it easy to generate them dynamically. Feel free to experiment with the provided code snippets and adapt them to your needs.
